# Deep-Learning-Practices-and-Mini-Projects
### This repository contains experiments and projects focused on deep learning, including:

* Here I am practicing traditional Deep Learning Approaches: Applying deep learning techniques to various datasets.
  
* Experimentation building deep learning algorithms and optimizers from the ground up, and do lot of experimentation.
  
* I will be doing Mathematical Exploration: Practicing mathematical concepts with code, such as implementing a perceptron from scratch.
  
* Also building Mini-Projects: Small-scale projects designed to apply deep learning techniques in practical scenarios.
  
* I will be doing MLOps Experiments: Integrating machine learning operations workflows, focusing on reproducibility and deployment.
  
### This repository will be regularly updated with new experiments and deep learning practices.
