## Here I do experiments and build mini notebooks related to Deep Learning and practice maths with python, behind algorithms

* This repository focuses on practicing traditional deep learning approaches by applying techniques to various datasets, building deep learning algorithms and optimizers from scratch, exploring mathematical concepts through code (such as implementing a perceptron), creating mini-projects to apply deep learning techniques in practical scenarios, and by practicing with design patterns and principles for clean code.
### This repository will be regularly updated with new experiments and deep learning practices.
